                                                                              Some(&quot;Counts the number of flits trasmitted across the QPI Link.  This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

If, for example, one wanted to count DRD Local Misses, one should select \&#39;MISS_OPC_MATCH\&#39; and set Cn_MSR_PMON_BOX_FILTER.opc to DRD (0x182)&quot;),

This event can be used in conjunction with the VNA In-Use Accumulator to calculate the average lifetime of a credit holder.  VNA credits are used by all message classes in order to communicate across QPI.  If a packet is unable to acquire credits, it will then attempt to use credts from the VN0 pool.  Note that a single packet may require multiple flit buffers (i.e. when data is being transfered).  Therefore, this event will increment by the number of credits acquired in each cycle.  Filtering based on message class is not provided.  One can count the number of packets transfered in a given message class using an qfclk event.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.&quot;),

L0p is a mode where we disable 1/2 of the QPI lanes, decreasing our bandwidth in order to save power.  It increases snoop and data transfer latencies and decreases overall bandwidth.  This mode can be very useful in NUMA optimized workloads that largely only utilize QPI for snoops and their responses.  Use edge detect to count the number of instances when the QPI link entered L0p.  Link power states are per link and per direction, so for example the Tx direction could be in one state while Rx was in another.&quot;),

There are up to 11 TAD (target address decode) regions in each home agent.  All requests destined for the memory controller must first be decoded to determine which TAD region they are in.

This event is useful for understanding how applications are using the memory that is spread across the different memory regions.

It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order to send writes into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a credit for the iMC\&#39;s WPQ (write pending queue).  This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general writes, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH writes.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.&quot;),

It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

L0p is a mode where we disable 1/2 of the QPI lanes, decreasing our bandwidth in order to save power.  It increases snoop and data transfer latencies and decreases overall bandwidth.  This mode can be very useful in NUMA optimized workloads that largely only utilize QPI for snoops and their responses.  Use edge detect to count the number of instances when the QPI link entered L0p.  Link power states are per link and per direction, so for example the Tx direction could be in one state while Rx was in another.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a request failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  This should generally be a rare situation.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.&quot;),

This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general writes, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH writes.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

Use edge detect to count the number of instances when the QPI link entered L1.  Link power states are per link and per direction, so for example the Tx direction could be in one state while Rx was in another. Because L1 totally shuts down the link, it takes a good amount of time to exit this mode.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.

The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

This can then be used to calculate the average occupancy (in conjunction with the Read Pending Queue Occupancy count).  The RPQ is used to schedule reads out to the memory controller and to track the requests.  Requests allocate into the RPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They deallocate after the CAS command has been issued to memory.  This filter is to be used in conjunction with the occupancy filter so that one can correctly track the average occupancies for schedulable entries and scheduled requests.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the \&#39;special\&#39; credits.  This statistic is generally not interesting for general IA workloads, but may be of interest for understanding the characteristics of systems using ISOCH.

VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a request failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  This should generally be a rare situation.&quot;),

This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the \&#39;special\&#39; credits.  This statistic is generally not interesting for general IA workloads, but may be of interest for understanding the characteristics of systems using ISOCH.

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from the ring stop.  We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This can then be used to calculate both the average queue occupancy (in conjunction with the number of cycles not empty) and the average latency (in conjunction with the number of allocations).  The WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and to track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They deallocate after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as soon they have \&#39;posted\&#39; to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average latency for this queue is actually not useful for deconstruction intermediate write latencies.  So, we provide filtering based on if the request has posted or not.  By using the \&#39;not posted\&#39; filter, we can track how long writes spent in the iMC before completions were sent to the HA.  The \&#39;posted\&#39; filter, on the other hand, provides information about how much queueing is actually happenning in the iMC for writes before they are actually issued to memory.  High average occupancies will generally coincide with high write major mode counts.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from  the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a request failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  This should generally be a rare situation.&quot;),

It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from  the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general writes, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH writes.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a request failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  This should generally be a rare situation.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order to send reads into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a credit for the iMC\&#39;s RPQ (read pending queue).  This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order to send reads into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a credit for the iMC\&#39;s RPQ (read pending queue).  This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order to send writes into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a credit for the iMC\&#39;s WPQ (write pending queue).  This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general writes, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH writes.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a request failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  This should generally be a rare situation.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from  the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.&quot;),

This can then be used to calculate the average queuing latency (in conjunction with the WPQ occupancy count).  The WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and to track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They deallocate after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as soon they have \&#39;posted\&#39; to the iMC.&quot;),

This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from  the ring stop.We really have two rings in JKT -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the \&#39;UP\&#39; direction is on the clockwise ring and \&#39;DN\&#39; is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.&quot;),

It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.&quot;),

It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This therefore counts the number of times when a request failed to acquire either a VNA or VN0 credit and is delayed.  This should generally be a rare situation.&quot;),

                                                                              Some(&quot;Counts the number of flits received from the QPI Link.  This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

In order to send reads into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a credit for the iMC\&#39;s RPQ (read pending queue).  This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.

In order to send reads into the memory controller, the HA must first acquire a credit for the iMC\&#39;s RPQ (read pending queue).  This queue is broken into regular credits/buffers that are used by general reads, and \&#39;special\&#39; requests such as ISOCH reads.  This count only tracks the regular credits  Common high banwidth workloads should be able to make use of all of the regular buffers, but it will be difficult (and uncommon) to make use of both the regular and special buffers at the same time.  One can filter based on the memory controller channel.  One or more channels can be tracked at a given time.&quot;),

This can then be used to calculate the average queue occupancy (in conjunction with the WPQ Occupancy Accumulation count).  The WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and to track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.  They deallocate after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as soon they have \&#39;posted\&#39; to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average latency for this queue is actually not useful for deconstruction intermediate write latencies.&quot;),

It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.&quot;),

Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN0.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN0 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN0 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN0 credit was used.  Note that a single VN0 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN0 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.&quot;),

If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary).&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

It is possible to filter this event by message class.  Some packets use more than one flit buffer, and therefore must acquire multiple credits.  Therefore, one could get a reject even if the VNA credits were not fully used up.  The VNA pool is generally used to provide the bulk of the QPI bandwidth (as opposed to the VN0 pool which is used to guarantee forward progress).  VNA credits can run out if the flit buffer on the receiving side starts to queue up substantially.  This can happen if the rest of the uncore is unable to drain the requests fast enough.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for SNP, HOM, and DRS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

There are up to 11 TAD (target address decode) regions in each home agent.  All requests destined for the memory controller must first be decoded to determine which TAD region they are in.

This event is useful for understanding how applications are using the memory that is spread across the different memory regions.

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

This is one of three \&#39;groups\&#39; that allow us to track flits.  It includes filters for NDR, NCB, and NCS message classes.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time.&quot;),

It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each \&#39;flit\&#39; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four \&#39;fits\&#39;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI \&#39;speed\&#39; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the \&#39;transfers\&#39; here refer to \&#39;fits\&#39;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 \&#39;flit\&#39; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual \&#39;data\&#39; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate \&#39;data\&#39; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.&quot;),

                <p>
                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code> or <code>* -> vec</code>)
                </p>
